# BookSearch# Book Search.
## Purpose
Be able to search and find books online with ease and speed
This application offers a quick and easy way to search for books according to the user’s choices. 

It helps people find the information they are looking for online using keywords or phrases. It can be custom words

It returns results quickly—even with millions of websites online by  scanning the Internet continuously and indexing every page they find.

This application will allow the user to search for the books of their choices using a Google Books API. Also, the user will be able to use Wikipedia API to search general reference material.

These APIs work by crawling hundreds of billions of pages using their own web crawlers. They navigates the web by downloading web pages and following links on these pages to discover new pages that have been made available.

By using Google Books API and Wikipedia API combined, this app provides more choices and faster results to the users.
